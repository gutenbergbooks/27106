KINEMATICS OF MECHANISMS FROM THE TIME OF WATT</h2>


<p><em>In an inventive tour de force that seldom, if ever, has been equalled
for its brilliance and far-reaching consequences, James Watt radically altered
the steam engine not only by adding a separate condenser but by creating a whole
new family of linkages. His approach was largely empirical, as we use the word
today.</em></p>

<p><em>This study suggests that, despite the glamor of today's sophisticated
methods of calculation, a highly developed intuitive sense, reinforced by a
knowledge of the past, is still indispensable to the design of successful
mechanisms.</em></p>

<p>THE AUTHOR: <em>Eugene S. Ferguson, formerly curator of mechanical and civil
engineering in the United States National Museum, Smithsonian Institution, is
now professor of mechanical engineering at Iowa State University of Science and
Technology.</em></p>

<p>In engineering schools today, a student is introduced to the kinematics of
mechanisms by means of a course of kinematic analysis, which is concerned with
principles underlying the motions occurring in mechanisms. These principles are
demonstrated by a study of mechanisms already in existence, such as the linkage
of a retractable landing gear, computing mechanisms, mechanisms used in an
automobile, and the like. A systematic, if not rigorous, approach to the design
of gears and cams also is usually presented in such a course. Until recently,
however, no serious attempt was made to apply the principles developed in
kinematic analysis to the more complex problem of kinematic synthesis of
linkages. By kinematic synthesis is meant the designing of a linkage to produce
a given series of motions for a particular purpose.</p>

<p>That a rational&#8212;numerical or geometrical&#8212;approach to kinematic synthesis is
possible is a relatively recent idea, not yet fully accepted; but it is this
idea that is responsible for the intense scholarly interest in the kinematics of
mechanisms that has occurred in this country within the last 10 years.</p>

<p>This scholarly activity has resulted in the rediscovery of many earlier works
on the subject, and nearly all the scholars now working in this field have
acknowledged in one way or another their debt to those who arrived on the scene
at an earlier time than they. There have been occasional reviews of the sequence
and nature of developments, but the emphasis naturally has been upon the recent
past. It seems to me that there is something to be gained in looking beyond our
own generation, or even beyond the time of Franz Reuleaux (1829-1905), who is
generally credited with originating many of our modern concepts of mechanism
analysis and design, and to inquire into the ideas that made possible Reuleaux's
contributions.</p>

<p>While no pretense of completeness is made, I have tried in this paper to
trace the high points in the development of kinematic analysis and synthesis,
both in academic circles and in the workshop, noting where possible the
influence of one upon the other. If I have devoted more space to particular
people and episodes than is warranted by their contributions to the modern
treatment of the subject, it is because I have found that the history of
kinematics of mechanisms, like the history of any other branch of engineering,
is more interesting and more plausible if it is recognized that its evolutionary
development is the result of human activity. This history was wrought by people
like us, no less intelligent and no less subject than we are to environment, to
a subjective way of looking at things, and to a heritage of ideas and beliefs.</p>

<p>I have selected the period from the time of Watt because modern mechanisms
originated with him, and I have emphasized the first century of the period
because by 1885 many of the ideas of modern kinematics of mechanisms were well
developed. Linkages are discussed, to the virtual exclusion of gears and cams,
because much of the scholarly work in kinematic synthesis is presently directed
toward the design of linkages and because linkages provide a convenient thread
for a narrative that would have become unnecessarily complex if detailed
treatment of gears and cams had been included. I have brought the narrative down
to the present by tracing kinematics as taught in American engineering schools,
closing with brief mention of the scholarly activity in kinematics in this
country since 1950. An annotated list of additional references is appended as an
encouragement to further work in the history of the subject.</p>


<h3><a name="James_Watt_Kinematic_Synthesist">James Watt, Kinematic Synthesist</a></h3>

<p>James Watt (1736-1819), improver of the steam engine, was a highly gifted
designer of mechanisms, although his background included no formal study of
mechanisms. Indeed, the study of mechanisms, without immediate regard to the
machines in which they were used, was not introduced until after Watt's
important work had been completed, while the actual design of mechanisms had
been going on for several centuries before the time of Watt.</p>

<p>Mechanisms that employed screws, cams, and gears were certainly in use by the
beginning of the Christian era. While I am not aware of unequivocal evidence of
the existence of four-bar linkages before the 16th century, their widespread
application by that time indicates that they probably originated much earlier. A
tantalizing 13th-century sketch of an up-and-down sawmill (fig. 1) suggests, but
does not prove, that the four-bar linkage was then in use. Leonardo da Vinci
(1452-1519) delineated, if he did not build, a crank and slider mechanism, also
for a sawmill (fig. 2). In the 16th century may be found the conversion of
rotary to reciprocating motion (strictly speaking, an oscillation through a
small arc of a large circle) and vice versa by use of linkages of rigid members
(figs. 3 and 4), although the conversion of rotary to reciprocating motion was
at that time more frequently accomplished by cams and intermittent gearing.
Nevertheless, the idea of linkages was a firmly established part of the
repertory of the machine builder before 1600. In fact one might have wondered in
1588, when Agostino Ramelli published his book on machines,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
whether linkages had not indeed reached their ultimate stage of development. To
illustrate my point, I have selected the plate of Ramelli that most appeals to
me (fig. 5), although the book exhibits more than 200 other machines of
comparable complexity and ingenuity.</p>

<p>There was a vast difference, both in conception and execution, between the
linkages of Ramelli and those of James Watt some 200 years later. Watt was
responsible for initiating profound changes in mechanical technology, but it
should be recognized that the mechanic arts had, through centuries of slow
development, reached the stage where his genius could flourish. The knowledge
and ability to provide the materials and tools necessary for Watt's researches
were at hand, and through the optimism and patient encouragement of his partner,
Matthew Boulton, they were placed at his disposal.</p>

<p>Watt's genius was nowhere more evident than in his synthesis of linkages. An
essential ingredient in the success of Watt's linkages, however, was his
partner's appreciation of the entirely new order of refinement that they called
for. Matthew Boulton, who had been a successful manufacturer of buttons and
metal novelties long before his partnership with Watt was formed, had recognized
at once the need for care in the building of Watt's steam engine. On February 7,
1769, he had written Watt:<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
&quot;I presumed that your engine would require money, very accurate workmanship and
extensive correspondence to make it turn out to the best advantage and that the
best means of keeping up the reputation and doing the invention justice would be
to keep the executive part of it out of the hands of the multitude of empirical
engineers, who from ignorance, want of experience and want of necessary
convenience, would be very liable to produce bad and inaccurate workmanship; all
of which deficiencies would affect the reputation of the invention.&quot; Boulton
expected to build the engines in his shop &quot;with as great a difference of
accuracy as there is between the blacksmith and the mathematical instrument
maker.&quot; The Soho Works of Boulton and Watt, in Birmingham, England, solved for
Watt the problem of producing &quot;in great&quot; (that is, in sizes large enough to be
useful in steam engines) the mechanisms that he devised.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

	of patent specification drawings.</p></div>

<p>The contributions of Boulton and Watt to practical mechanics &quot;in great&quot;
cannot be overestimated. There were in the 18th century instrument makers and
makers of timekeepers who had produced astonishingly accurate work, but such
work comprised relatively small items, all being within the scope of a bench
lathe, hand tools, and superb handwork. The rapid advancement of machine tools,
which greatly expanded the scope of the machine-building art, began during the
Boulton and Watt partnership (1775-1800).</p>

<p>In April 1775 the skirmish at Concord between American colonists and British
redcoats marked the beginning of a war that was to determine for the future the
course of political events in the Western Hemisphere.</p>

<p>Another event of April 1775 occurring in Birmingham now appears to have been
one that marked the beginning of a new era of technological advance. It was near
the end of this month that Boulton, at the Soho Works, wrote to his partner and
commented upon receiving the cast iron steam engine cylinder that had been
finished in John Wilkinson's boring mill:</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">... it seems tolerably true, but is an inch
thick and weighs about</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">10 cwt. Its diameter is about as much above 18
inches as the tin</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">one was under, and therefore it is become
necessary to add a brass</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">hoop to the piston, which is made almost two
inches broad.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></span><br />
</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">
	[4]</span></a> <em>Ibid.</em>, vol. 2, p. 84.</p></div>

<p>This cylinder indeed marked the turning point in the discouragingly long
development of the Watt steam engine, which for 10 years had occupied nearly all
of Watt's thoughts and all the time he could spare from the requirements of
earning a living. Although there were many trials ahead for the firm of Boulton
and Watt in further developing and perfecting the steam engine, the crucial
problem of leakage of steam past the piston in the cylinder had now been solved
by Wilkinson's new boring mill, which was the first large machine tool capable
of boring a cylinder both round and straight.</p>

<p>The boring mill is pertinent to the development of linkages &quot;in great,&quot; being
the first of a new class of machine tools that over the next 50 or 60 years came
to include nearly all of the basic types of heavy chip-removing tools that are
in use today. The development of tools was accelerated by the inherent accuracy
required of the linkages that were originated by Watt. Once it had been
demonstrated that a large and complex machine, such as the steam engine, could
be built accurately enough so that its operation would be relatively free of
trouble, many outstanding minds became engaged in the development of machines
and tools. It is interesting, however, to see how Watt and others grappled with
the solutions of problems that resulted from the advance of the steam engine.</p>

<p>During the 1770's the demand for continuous, dependable power applied to a
rotating shaft was becoming insistent, and much of Boulton's and Watt's effort
was directed toward meeting this demand. Mills of all kinds used water or horses
to turn &quot;wheel-work,&quot; but, while these sources of power were adequate for small
operations, the quantity of water available was often limited, and the use of
enormous horse-whims was frequently impracticable.</p>

<p>The only type of steam engine then in existence was the Newcomen beam engine,
which had been introduced in 1712 by Thomas Newcomen, also an Englishman. This
type of engine was widely used, mostly for pumping water out of mines but
occasionally for pumping water into a reservoir to supply a waterwheel. It was
arranged with a vertical steam cylinder located beneath one end of a large
pivoted working beam and a vertical plunger-type pump beneath the other end.
Heavy, flat chains were secured to a sector at each end of the working beam and
to the engine and pump piston rods in such a way that the rods were always
tangent to a circle whose center was at the beam pivot. The weight of the
reciprocating pump parts pulled the pump end of the beam down; the atmosphere,
acting on the open top of the piston in the steam cylinder, caused the engine
end of the beam to be pulled down when the steam beneath the piston was
condensed. The chains would of course transmit force from piston to beam only in
tension.</p>

<p>It is now obvious that a connecting rod, a crank, and a sufficiently heavy
flywheel might have been used in a conventional Newcomen engine in order to
supply power to a rotating shaft, but contemporary evidence makes it clear that
this solution was by no means obvious to Watt nor to his contemporaries.</p>

<p>At the time of his first engine patent, in 1769, Watt had devised a &quot;steam
wheel,&quot; or rotary engine, that used liquid mercury in the lower part of a
toroidal chamber to provide a boundary for steam spaces successively formed by
flap gates within the chamber. The practical difficulties of construction
finally ruled out this solution to the problem of a rotating power source, but
not until after Boulton and Watt had spent considerable effort and money on it.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

	material, of the development of Watt's many contributions to mechanical
	technology. It is ably summarized in Dickinson, <em>op. cit.</em>
	(footnote 2).</p></div>

<p>In 1777 a speaker before the Royal Society in London observed that in order
to obtain rotary output from a reciprocating steam engine, a crank &quot;naturally
occurs in theory,&quot; but that in fact the crank is impractical because of the
irregular rate of going of the engine and its variable length of stroke. He said
that on the first variation of length of stroke the machine would be &quot;either
broken to pieces, or turned back.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
John Smeaton, in the front rank of English steam engineers of his time, was
asked in 1781 by His Majesty's Victualling-Office for his opinion as to whether
a steam-powered grain mill ought to be driven by a crank or by a waterwheel
supplied by a pump. Smeaton's conclusion was that the crank was quite unsuited
to a machine in which regularity of operation was a factor. &quot;I apprehend,&quot; he
wrote, &quot;that no motion communicated from the reciprocating beam of a fire engine
can ever act perfectly equal and steady in producing a circular motion, like the
regular efflux of water in turning a waterwheel.&quot; He recommended, incidentally,
that a Boulton and Watt steam engine be used to pump water to supply the
waterwheel.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
Smeaton had thought of a flywheel, but he reasoned that a flywheel large enough
to smooth out the halting, jerky operation of the steam engines that he had
observed would be more of an encumbrance than a pump, reservoir, and waterwheel.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>The simplicity of the eventual solution of the problem was not clear to Watt
at this time. He was not, as tradition has it, blocked merely by the existence
of a patent for a simple crank and thus forced to invent some other device as a
substitute.</p>

<p>Matthew Wasbrough, of Bristol, the engineer commonly credited with the crank
patent, made no mention of a crank in his patent specification, but rather
intended to make use of &quot;racks with teeth,&quot; or &quot;one or more pullies, wheels,
segments of wheels, to which are fastened rotchets and clicks or palls....&quot; He
did, however, propose to &quot;add a fly or flys, in order to render the motion more
regular and uniform.&quot; Unfortunately for us, he submitted no drawings with his
patent specification.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>James Pickard, of Birmingham, like Boulton, a buttonmaker, in 1780 patented a
counterweighted crank device (fig. 6) that was expected to remove the objection
to a crank, which operated with changing leverage and thus irregular power. In
figure 6, the counterweighted wheel, revolving twice for each revolution of the
crank (A), would allow the counterweight to descend while the crank passed the
dead-center position and would be raised while the crank had maximum leverage.
No mention of a flywheel was made in this patent.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>Figure 6.&#8212;One of the steam engine &quot;Crank Patents&quot; that
hindered James Watt's progress. This patent, granted to James Pickard in 1780,
claimed only the arrangement of counterweights, not the crank. The crank pin to
which the connecting rod was attached is at <em>Aa</em>. From British Patent
1263, August 23, 1780.</p>

<p>Wasbrough, finding that his &quot;rotchets and clicks&quot; did not serve, actually
used, in 1780, a crank with a flywheel. Watt was aware of this, but he remained
unconvinced of the superiority of the crank over other devices and did not
immediately appreciate the regulating ability of a flywheel.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
In April 1781 Watt wrote to Boulton, who was then out of town: &quot;I know from
experiment that the other contrivance, which you saw me try, performs at least
as well, and has in fact many advantages over the crank.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
The &quot;other contrivance&quot; probably was his swash wheel which he built and which
appeared on his next important patent specification (fig. 7a). Also in this
patent were four other devices, one of which was easily recognizable as a crank,
and two of which were eccentrics (fig. 7a, b). The fourth device was the
well-known sun-and-planet gearing (fig. 7e).<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
In spite of the similarity of the simple crank to the several variations devised
by Watt, this patent drew no fire from Wasbrough or Pickard, perhaps because no
reasonable person would contend that the crank itself was a patentable feature,
or perhaps because the similarity was not at that time so obvious. However, Watt
steered clear of directly discernible application of cranks because he preferred
to avoid a suit that might overthrow his or other patents. For example, if the
Wasbrough and Pickard patents had been voided, they would have become public
property; and Watt feared that they might &quot;get into the hands of men more
ingenious,&quot; who would give Boulton and Watt more competition than Wasbrough and
Pickard.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>(e) Sun-and-planet gearing. This is the idea actually employed
in Boulton and Watt engines. As the optional link <em>JK</em> held the
gearwheel centers always equidistant, the annular guide <em>G</em> was not used.</p>

<p>The sun-and-planet arrangement, with gears of equal size, was adopted by Watt
for nearly all the rotative engines that he built during the term of the &quot;crank
patents.&quot; This arrangement had the advantage of turning the flywheel through two
revolutions during a single cycle of operation of the piston, thus requiring a
flywheel only one-fourth the size of the flywheel needed if a simple crank were
used. The optional link (JK of fig. 7e) was used in the engines as built.</p>

<p>From the first, the rotative engines were made double-acting&#8212;that is, work
was done by steam alternately in each end of the cylinder. The double-acting
engine, unlike the single-acting pumping engine, required a piston rod that
would push as well as pull. It was in the solution of this problem that Watt's
originality and sure judgment were most clearly demonstrated.</p>

<p>A rack and sector arrangement (fig. 8) was used on some engines. The first
one, according to Watt, &quot;has broke out several teeth of the rack, but works
steady.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
A little later he told a correspondent that his double-acting engine &quot;acts so
powerfully that it has broken all its tackling repeatedly. We have now tamed it,
however.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>It was about a year later that the straight-line linkage<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
was thought out. &quot;I have started a new hare,&quot; Watt wrote to his partner. &quot;I have
got a glimpse of a method of causing the piston-rod to move up and down
perpendicularly, by only fixing it to a piece of iron upon the beam, without
chains, or perpendicular guides, or untowardly frictions, arch-heads, or other
pieces of clumsiness.... I have only tried it in a slight model yet, so cannot
build upon it, though I think it a very probable thing to succeed, and one of
the most ingenious simple pieces of mechanism I have contrived....&quot;<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

	[17]</span></a> Watt's was a four-bar linkage. All four-bar straight-line
	linkages that have no sliding pairs trace only an approximately straight
	line. The exact straight-line linkage in a single plane was not known until
	1864 (see p. 204). In 1853 Pierre-Frédéric Sarrus (1798-1861), a French
	professor of mathematics at Strasbourg, devised an accordion-like spatial
	linkage that traced a true straight line. Described but not illustrated (Académie
	des Sciences, Paris, <em>Comptes rendus</em>, 1853, vol. 36, pp. 1036-1038, 1125),
	the mechanism was forgotten and twice reinvented; finally, the original
	invention was rediscovered by an English writer in 1905. For chronology, see Florian Cajori,
	<em>A History of Mathematics</em>, ed. 2, New York, 1919, p. 301.</p></div>

<p>Watt's marvelously simple straight-line linkage was incorporated into a large
beam engine almost immediately, and the usually pessimistic and reserved
inventor was close to a state of elation when he told Boulton that the &quot;new
central perpendicular motion answers beyond expectation, and does not make the
shadow of a noise.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>

alternative devices are illustrated here (fig. 9). One of the alternatives is a
guided crosshead (fig. 9, top right).</p>

<p>Brilliant as was the conception of this linkage, it was followed up by a
synthesis that is very little short of incredible. In order to make the linkage
attached to the beam of his engines more compact, Watt had plumbed his
experience for ideas; his experience had yielded up the work done much earlier
on a drafting machine that made use of a pantograph.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
Watt combined his straight-line linkage with a pantograph, one link becoming a
member of the pantograph.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_20_20" id="Footnote_20_20"></a><a href="#FNanchor_20_20"><span class="label">
	[20]</span></a> &quot;It has only one fault,&quot; he had told a friend on December
	24, 1773, after describing the drafting machine to him, &quot;which is, that it
	will not do, because it describes conic sections instead of straight lines.&quot;
	<em>Ibid.</em>, p. 71.</p></div>

<p>The length of each oscillating link of the straight-line linkage was thus
reduced to one-fourth instead of one-half the beam length, and the entire
mechanism could be constructed so that it would not extend beyond the end of the
working beam. This arrangement soon came to be known as Watt's &quot;parallel motion&quot;
(fig. 10).<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
Years later Watt told his son: &quot;Though I am not over anxious after fame, yet I
am more proud of the parallel motion than of any other mechanical invention I
have ever made.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_21_21" id="Footnote_21_21"></a><a href="#FNanchor_21_21"><span class="label">
	[21]</span></a> Throughout the 19th century the term &quot;parallel motion&quot; was
	used indiscriminately to refer to any straight-line linkage. I have not
	discovered the origin of the term. Watt did not use it in his patent
	specification, and I have not found it in his writings or elsewhere before
	1808 (see footnote 22). <em>The Cyclopaedia</em> (Abraham Rees, ed., London, 1819,
	vol. 26) defined parallel motion as &quot;a term used among practical mechanics
	to denote the rectilinear motion of a piston-rod, &amp;c. in the direction of
	its length; and contrivances, by which such alternate rectilinear motions
	are converted into continuous rotatory ones, or <em>vice versa</em>....&quot;
	Robert Willis in his <em>Principles of Mechanism</em> (London, 1841, p.
	399) described parallel motion as &quot;a term somewhat awkwardly applied to a
	combination of jointed rods, the purpose of which is to cause a point to
	describe a straight line....&quot; A. B. Kempe in <em>How to Draw a Straight
	Line</em> (London, 1877, p. 49) wrote: &quot;I have been more than once asked to
	get rid of the objectionable term 'parallel motion.' I do not know how it
	came to be employed, and it certainly does not express what is intended. The
	expression, however, has now become crystallised, and I for one cannot
	undertake to find a solvent.&quot;</p></div>

<p>The Watt four-bar linkage was employed 75 years after its inception by the
American Charles B. Richards when, in 1861, he designed his first high-speed
engine indicator (fig. 11). Introduced into England the following year, the
Richards Indicator was an immediate success, and many thousands were sold over
the next 20 or 30 years.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>In considering the order of synthetic ability required to design the
straight-line linkage and to combine it with a pantograph, it should be kept in
mind that this was the first one of a long line of such mechanisms.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
Once the idea was abroad, it was only to be expected that many variations and
alternative solutions should appear. One wonders, however, what direction the
subsequent work would have taken if Watt had not so clearly pointed the way.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_24_24" id="Footnote_24_24"></a><a href="#FNanchor_24_24"><span class="label">
	[24]</span></a> At least one earlier straight-line linkage, an arrangement
	later ascribed to Richard Roberts, had been depicted before Watt's patent
	(Pierre Patte, <em>Mémoirs sur les objets les plus importants de
	l'architecture</em>, Paris, 1769, p. 229 and pl. 11). However, this linkage
	(reproduced here in figure 18) had no detectable influence on Watt or on
	subsequent practice.</p></div>

<p>In 1827 John Farey, in his exhaustive study of the steam engine, wrote
perhaps the best contemporary view of Watt's work. Farey as a young man had
several times talked with the aging Watt, and he had reflected upon the nature
of the intellect that had caused Watt to be recognized as a genius, even within
his own lifetime. In attempting to explain Watt's genius, Farey set down some
observations that are pertinent not only to kinematic synthesis but to the
currently fashionable term &quot;creativity.&quot;</p>

<p>In Farey's opinion Watt's inventive faculty was far superior to that of any
of his contemporaries; but his many and various ideas would have been of little
use if he had not possessed a very high order of judgment, that &quot;faculty of
distinguishing between ideas; decomposing compound ideas into more simple
elements; arranging them into classes, and comparing them together....&quot;</p>

<p>Farey was of the opinion that while a mind like Watt's could produce
brilliant new ideas, still the &quot;common stock of ideas which are current amongst
communities and professions, will generally prove to be of a better quality than
the average of those new ideas, which can be produced by any individual from the
operation of his own mind, without assistance from others.&quot; Farey concluded with
the observation that &quot;the most useful additions to that common stock, usually
proceed from the individuals who are well acquainted with the whole series.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<h3><a name="To_Draw_a_Straight_Line">To Draw a Straight Line</a></h3>

<p>During most of the century after James Watt had produced his parallel motion,
the problem of devising a linkage, one point of which would describe a straight
line, was one that tickled the fancies of mathematicians, of ingenious
mechanics, and of gentlemanly dabblers in ideas. The quest for a straight-line
mechanism more accurate than that of Watt far outlasted the pressing practical
need for such a device. Large metal planing machines were well known by 1830,
and by midcentury crossheads and crosshead guides were used on both sides of the
Atlantic in engines with and without working beams.</p>

<p>By 1819 John Farey had observed quite accurately that, in England at least,
many other schemes had been tried and found wanting and that &quot;no methods have
been found so good as the original engine; and we accordingly find, that all the
most established and experienced manufacturers make engines which are not
altered in any great feature from Mr. Watt's original engine....&quot;<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>Two mechanisms for producing a straight line were introduced before the
Boulton and Watt monopoly ended in 1800. Perhaps the first was by Edmund
Cartwright (1743-1823), who is said to have had the original idea for a power
loom. This geared device (fig. 12), was characterized patronizingly by a
contemporary American editor as possessing &quot;as much merit as can possibly be
attributed to a gentleman engaged in the pursuit of mechanical studies for his
own amusement.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>

<p>The properties of a hypocycloid were recognized by James White, an English
engineer, in his geared design which employed a pivot located on the pitch
circle of a spur gear revolving inside an internal gear. The diameter of the
pitch circle of the spur gear was one-half that of the internal gear, with the
result that the pivot, to which the piston rod was connected, traced out a
diameter of the large pitch circle (fig. 13). White in 1801 received from
Napoleon Bonaparte a medal for this invention when it was exhibited at an
industrial exposition in Paris.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
Some steam engines employing White's mechanism were built, but without
conspicuous commercial success. White himself rather agreed that while his
invention was &quot;allowed to possess curious properties, and to be a <em>pretty</em>
thing, opinions do not all concur in declaring it, essentially and generally, a
<em>good</em> thing.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>The first of the non-Watt four-bar linkages appeared shortly after 1800. The
origin of the grasshopper beam motion is somewhat obscure, although it came to
be associated with the name of Oliver Evans, the American pioneer in the
employment of high-pressure steam. A similar idea, employing an isosceles
linkage, was patented in 1803 by William Freemantle, an English watchmaker (fig.
14).<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
This is the linkage that was attributed much later to John Scott Russell
(1808-1882), the prominent naval architect.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
An inconclusive hint that Evans had devised his straight-line linkage by 1805
appeared in a plate illustrating his <em>Abortion of the Young Steam Engineer's
Guide</em> (Philadelphia, 1805), and it was certainly used on his Columbian
engine (fig. 15), which was built before 1813. The Freemantle linkage, in
modified form, appeared in Rees's <em>Cyclopaedia</em> of 1819 (fig. 16), but
it is doubtful whether even this would have been readily recognized as identical
with the Evans linkage, because the connecting rod was at the opposite end of
the working beam from the piston rod, in accordance with established usage,
while in the Evans linkage the crank and connecting rod were at the same end of
the beam. It is possible that Evans got his idea from an earlier English
periodical, but concrete evidence is lacking.</p>

Oliver Evans, and he was not a man of excessive modesty where his own inventions
were concerned.</p>

<p>Another four-bar straight-line linkage that became well known was attributed
to Richard Roberts of Manchester (1789-1864), who around 1820 had built one of
the first metal planing machines, which machines helped make the quest for
straight-line linkages largely academic. I have not discovered what occasioned
the introduction of the Roberts linkage, but it dated from before 1841. Although
Roberts patented many complex textile machines, an inspection of all of his
patent drawings has failed to provide proof that he was the inventor of the
Roberts linkage.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
The fact that the same linkage is shown in an engraving of 1769 (fig. 18)

not employ the straight-line linkage. From Pierre Patte, <em>Memoirs sur les objets

<p>The appearance in 1864 of Peaucellier's exact straight-line linkage went
nearly unnoticed. A decade later, when news of its invention crossed the Channel
to England, this linkage excited a flurry of interest, and variations of it
occupied mathematical minds for several years. For at least 10 years before and
20 years after the final solution of the problem, Professor Chebyshev,<a name="FNanchor_36_37" id="FNanchor_36_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_37" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
a noted mathematician of the University of St. Petersburg, was interested in the
matter. Judging by his published works and his reputation abroad, Chebyshev's
interest amounted to an obsession.</p>

<p>Pafnutï&#301; L'vovich Chebyshev was born in 1821, near Moscow, and entered the
University of Moscow in 1837. In 1853, after visiting France and England and
observing carefully the progress of applied mechanics in those countries, he
read his first paper on approximate straight-line linkages, and over the next 30
years he attacked the problem with new vigor at least a dozen times. He found
that the two principal straight-line linkages then in use were Watt's and
Evans'. Chebyshev noted the departure of these linkages from a straight line and
calculated the deviation as of the fifth degree, or about 0.0008 inch per inch
of beam length. He proposed a modification of the Watt linkage to refine its
accuracy but found that he would have to more than double the length of the
working beam. Chebyshev concluded ruefully that his modification would &quot;present
great practical difficulties.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_37_38" id="FNanchor_37_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_38" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

	1899-1907, vol. 1, p. 538; vol. 2, pp. 57, 85.</p></div>

<p>At length an idea occurred to Chebyshev that would enable him to approach if
not quite attain a true straight line. If one mechanism was good, he reasoned,
two would be better, <em>et cetera, ad infinitum</em>. The idea was simply to combine,
or compound, four-link approximate linkages, arranging them in such a way that
the errors would be successively reduced. Contemplating first a combination of
the Watt and Evans linkages (fig. 19), Chebyshev recognized that if point D of
the Watt linkage followed nearly a straight line, point A of the Evans linkage
would depart even less from a straight line. He calculated the deviation in this
case as of the 11th degree. He then replaced Watt's linkage by one that is
usually called the Chebyshev straight-line mechanism (fig. 20), with the result
that precision was increased to the 13th degree.<a name="FNanchor_38_39" id="FNanchor_38_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_39" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
The steam engine that he displayed at the Vienna Exhibition in 1873 employed
this linkage&#8212;the Chebyshev mechanism compounded with the Evans, or approximate
isosceles, linkage. An English visitor to the exhibition commented that &quot;the
motion is of little or no practical use, for we can scarcely imagine
circumstances under which it would be more advantageous to use such a
complicated system of levers, with so many joints to be lubricated and so many
pins to wear, than a solid guide of some kind; but at the same time the
arrangement is very ingenious and in this respect reflects great credit on its
designer.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_39_40" id="FNanchor_39_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_40" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>There is a persistent rumor that Professor Chebyshev sought to demonstrate
the impossibility of constructing any linkage, regardless of the number of
links, that would generate a straight line; but I have found only a dubious
statement in the <em>Grande Encyclopédie</em><a name="FNanchor_40_41" id="FNanchor_40_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_41" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
of the late 19th century and a report of a conversation with the Russian by an

parallel motion....&quot;<a name="FNanchor_41_42" id="FNanchor_41_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_42" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
Regardless of what tradition may have to say about what Chebyshev said, it is of
course well known that Captain Peaucellier was the man who finally synthesized
the exact straight-line mechanism that bears his name.</p>

(1814-1897), mathematician and lecturer on straight-line linkages. From
<em>Proceedings of the Royal Society of London </em>(1898, vol. 63, opposite p.

<p>Charles-Nicolas Peaucellier, a graduate of the Ecole Polytechnique and a
captain in the French corps of engineers, was 32 years old in 1864 when he wrote
a short letter to the editor of <em>Nouvelles Annales de mathématiques</em> (ser. 2,
vol. 3, pp. 414-415) in Paris. He called attention to what he termed &quot;compound
compasses,&quot; a class of linkages that included Watt's parallel motion, the
pantograph, and the polar planimeter. He proposed to design linkages to describe
a straight line, a circle of any radius no matter how large, and conic sections,
and he indicated in his letter that he had arrived at a solution.</p>

<p>This letter stirred no pens in reply, and during the next 10 years the
problem merely led to the filling of a few academic pages by Peaucellier and
Amédée Mannheim (1831-1906), also a graduate of Ecole Polytechnique, a professor
of mathematics, and the designer of the Mannheim slide rule. Finally, in 1873,
Captain Peaucellier gave his solution to the readers of the <em>Nouvelles Annales</em>.
His reasoning, which has a distinct flavor of discovery by hindsight, was that
since a linkage generates a curve that can be expressed algebraically, it must
follow that any algebraic curve can be generated by a suitable linkage&#8212;it was
only necessary to find the suitable linkage. He then gave a neat geometric
proof, suggested by Mannheim, for his straight-line &quot;compound compass.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_42_43" id="FNanchor_42_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_43" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>On a Friday evening in January 1874 Albemarle Street in London was filled
with carriages, each maneuvering to unload its charge of gentlemen and their
ladies at the door of the venerable hall of the Royal Institution. Amidst a
&quot;mighty rustling of silks,&quot; the elegant crowd made its way to the auditorium for
one of the famous weekly lectures. The speaker on this occasion was James Joseph
Sylvester, a small intense man with an enormous head, sometime professor of
mathematics at the University of Virginia, in America, and more recently at the
Royal Military Academy in Woolwich. He spoke from the same rostrum that had been
occupied by Davy, Faraday, Tyndall, Maxwell, and many other notable scientists.
Professor Sylvester's subject was &quot;Recent Discoveries in Mechanical Conversion
of Motion.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_43_44" id="FNanchor_43_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_44" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

	[43]</span></a> Sylvester, <em>op. cit.</em> (footnote 41), pp. 179-198. It appears
	from a comment in this lecture that Sylvester was responsible for the word
	&quot;linkage.&quot; According to Sylvester, a linkage consists of an even number of
	links, a &quot;link-work&quot; of an odd number. Since the fixed member was not
	considered as a link by Sylvester, this distinction became utterly confusing
	when Reuleaux's work was published in 1876. Although &quot;link&quot; was used by Watt
	in a patent specification, it is not probable that he ever used the term
	&quot;link-work&quot;&#8212;at any rate, my search for his use of it has been fruitless.
	&quot;Link work&quot; is used by Willis (<em>op. cit.</em> footnote 21), but the term most
	likely did not originate with him. I have not found the word &quot;linkage&quot; used
	earlier than Sylvester.</p></div>

<p>Remarking upon the popular appeal of most of the lectures, a contemporary
observer noted that while many listeners might prefer to hear Professor Tyndall
expound on the acoustic opacity of the atmosphere, &quot;those of a higher and drier
turn of mind experience ineffable delight when Professor Sylvester holds forth
on the conversion of circular into parallel motion.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_44_45" id="FNanchor_44_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_45" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>Sylvester's aim was to bring the Peaucellier linkage to the notice of the
English-speaking world, as it had been brought to his attention by
Chebyshev&#8212;during a recent visit of the Russian to England&#8212;and to give his
listeners some insight into the vastness of the field that he saw opened by the
discovery of the French soldier.<a name="FNanchor_45_46" id="FNanchor_45_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_46" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>&quot;The perfect parallel motion of Peaucellier looks so simple,&quot; he observed,
&quot;and moves so easily that people who see it at work almost universally express
astonishment that it waited so long to be discovered.&quot; But that was not his
reaction at all. The more one reflects upon the problem, Sylvester continued, he
&quot;wonders the more that it was ever found out, and can see no reason why it
should have been discovered for a hundred years to come. Viewed <em>a priori</em> there
was nothing to lead up to it. It bears not the remotest analogy (except in the
fact of a double centring) to Watt's parallel motion or any of its progeny.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_46_47" id="FNanchor_46_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_47" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>It must be pointed out, parenthetically at least, that James Watt had not
only had to solve the problem as best he could, but that he had no inkling, so
far as experience was concerned, that a solvable problem existed.</p>

<p>Sylvester interrupted his panegyric long enough to enumerate some of the
practical results of the Peaucellier linkage. He said that Mr. Penrose, the
eminent architect and surveyor to St. Paul's Cathedral, had &quot;put up a house-pump
worked by a negative Peaucellier cell, to the great wonderment of the plumber
employed, who could hardly believe his senses when he saw the sling attached to
the piston-rod moving in a true vertical line, instead of wobbling as usual from
side to side.&quot; Sylvester could see no reason &quot;why the perfect parallel motion
should not be employed with equal advantage in the construction of ordinary
water-closets.&quot; The linkage was to be employed by &quot;a gentleman of fortune&quot; in a
marine engine for his yacht, and there was talk of using it to guide a piston
rod &quot;in certain machinery connected with some new apparatus for the ventilation
and filtration of the air of the Houses of Parliament.&quot; In due course, Mr. Prim,
&quot;engineer to the Houses,&quot; was pleased to show his adaptation of the Peaucellier
linkage to his new blowing engines, which proved to be exceptionally quiet in
their operation (fig. 25).<a name="FNanchor_47_48" id="FNanchor_47_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_48" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
A bit on the ludicrous side, also, was Sylvester's 78-bar linkage that traced a
straight line along the line connecting the two fixed centers of the linkage.<a name="FNanchor_48_49" id="FNanchor_48_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_49" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>Before dismissing with a smile the quaint ideas of our Victorian forbears,
however, it is well to ask, 88 years later, whether some rather elaborate work
reported recently on the synthesis of straight-line mechanisms is more to the
point, when the principal objective appears to be the moving of an indicator on
a &quot;pleasing, expanded&quot; (i.e., squashed flat) radio dial.<a name="FNanchor_49_50" id="FNanchor_49_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_50" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>But Professor Sylvester was more interested, really, in the mathematical
possibilities of the Peaucellier linkage, as no doubt our modern investigators
are. Through a compounding of Peaucellier mechanisms, he had already devised
square-root and cube-root extractors, an angle trisector, and a
quadratic-binomial root extractor, and he could see no limits to the computing
abilities of linkages as yet undiscovered.<a name="FNanchor_50_51" id="FNanchor_50_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_51" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>Sylvester recalled fondly, in a footnote to his lecture, his experience with
a little mechanical model of the Peaucellier linkage at an earlier dinner
meeting of the Philosophical Club of the Royal Society. The Peaucellier model
had been greeted by the members with lively expressions of admiration &quot;when it
was brought in with the dessert, to be seen by them after dinner, as is the
laudable custom among members of that eminent body in making known to each other
the latest scientific novelties.&quot; And Sylvester would never forget the reaction
of his brilliant friend Sir William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin) upon being
handed the same model in the Athenaeum Club. After Sir William had operated it
for a time, Sylvester reached for the model, but he was rebuffed by the
exclamation &quot;No! I have not had nearly enough of it&#8212;it is the most beautiful
thing I have ever seen in my life.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_51_52" id="FNanchor_51_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_52" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>The aftermath of Professor Sylvester's performance at the Royal Institution
was considerable excitement amongst a limited company of interested
mathematicians. Many alternatives to the Peaucellier straight-line linkage were
suggested by several writers of papers for learned journals.<a name="FNanchor_52_53" id="FNanchor_52_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_53" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>In the summer of 1876, after Sylvester had departed from England to take up
his post as professor of mathematics in the new Johns Hopkins University in
Baltimore, Alfred Bray Kempe, a young barrister who pursued mathematics as a
hobby, delivered at London's South Kensington Museum a lecture with the
provocative title &quot;How to Draw a Straight Line.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_53_54" id="FNanchor_53_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_54" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

	[53]</span></a> Kempe, <em>op. cit.</em> (footnote 21), p. 26.</p></div>

<p>In order to justify the Peaucellier linkage, Kempe belabored the point that a
perfect circle could be generated by means of a pivoted bar and a pencil, while
the generation of a straight line was most difficult if not impossible until
Captain Peaucellier came along. A straight line could be drawn along a straight
edge; but how was one to determine whether the straight edge was straight? He
did not weaken his argument by suggesting the obvious possibility of using a
piece of string. Kempe had collaborated with Sylvester in pursuing the latter's
first thoughts on the subject, and one result, that to my mind exemplifies the
general direction of their thinking, was the Sylvester-Kempe &quot;parallel motion&quot;

<p>Enthusiastic as Kempe was, however, he injected an apologetic note in his
lecture. &quot;That these results are valuable cannot I think be doubted,&quot; he said,
&quot;though it may well be that their great beauty has led some to attribute to them
an importance which they do not really possess....&quot; He went on to say that 50
years earlier, before the great improvements in the production of true plane
surfaces, the straight-line mechanisms would have been more important than in
1876, but he added that &quot;linkages have not at present, I think, been
sufficiently put before the mechanician to enable us to say what value should
really be set upon them.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_54_55" id="FNanchor_54_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_55" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>It was during this same summer of 1876, at the Loan Exhibition of Scientific
Apparatus in the South Kensington Museum, that the work of Franz Reuleaux, which
was to have an important and lasting influence on kinematics everywhere, was
first introduced to English engineers. Some 300 beautifully constructed teaching
aids, known as the Berlin kinematic models, were loaned to the exhibition by the
Royal Industrial School in Berlin, of which Reuleaux was the director. These
models were used by Prof. Alexander B. W. Kennedy of University College, London,
to help explain Reuleaux's new and revolutionary theory of machines.<a name="FNanchor_55_56" id="FNanchor_55_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_56" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>When, in 1829, André-Marie Ampère (1775-1836) was called upon to prepare a
course in theoretical and experimental physics for the Collège de France, he
first set about determining the limits of the field of physics. This exercise
suggested to his wide-ranging intellect not only the definition of physics but
the classification of all human knowledge. He prepared his scheme of
classification, tried it out on his physics students, found it incomplete,
returned to his study, and produced finally a two-volume work wherein the
province of kinematics was first marked out for all to see and consider.<a name="FNanchor_56_57" id="FNanchor_56_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_57" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
Only a few lines could be devoted to so specialized a branch as kinematics, but
Ampère managed to capture the central idea of the subject.</p>

<p>Cinématique (from the Greek word for movement) was, according to Ampère, the
science &quot;in which movements are considered in themselves [independent of the
forces which produce them], as we observe them in solid bodies all about us, and
especially in the assemblages called machines.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_57_58" id="FNanchor_57_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_58" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>
Kinematics, as the study soon came to be known in English,<a name="FNanchor_58_59" id="FNanchor_58_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_59" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>
was one of the two branches of elementary mechanics, the other being statics.</p>

	&quot;kinematics,&quot; and this Anglicization subsequently became the standard term
	for this branch of mechanics.</p></div>

<p>In his definition of kinematics, Ampère stated what the faculty of
mathematics at the Ecole Polytechnique, in Paris, had been groping toward since
the school's opening some 40 years earlier. The study of mechanisms as an
intellectual discipline most certainly had its origin on the left bank of the
Seine, in this school spawned, as suggested by one French historian,<a name="FNanchor_59_60" id="FNanchor_59_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_60" class="fnanchor">[[59]</a>
by the great <em>Encyclopédie</em> of Diderot and d'Alembert.</p>

	Leonhard Euler of the 18th century.</p></div>

<p>Because the Ecole Polytechnique had such a far-reaching influence upon the
point of view from which mechanisms were contemplated by scholars for nearly a
century after the time of Watt, and by compilers of dictionaries of mechanical
movements for an even longer time, it is well to look for a moment at the early
work that was done there. If one is interested in origins, it might be
profitable for him to investigate the military school in the ancient town of
Mézières, about 150 miles northeast of Paris. It was here that Lazare Carnot,
one of the principal founders of the Ecole Polytechnique, in 1783 published his
essay on machines,<a name="FNanchor_60_61" id="FNanchor_60_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_61" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>
which was concerned, among other things, with showing the impossibility of
&quot;perpetual motion&quot;; and it was from Mézières that Gaspard Monge and Jean
Hachette<a name="FNanchor_61_62" id="FNanchor_61_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_62" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
came to Paris to work out the system of mechanism classification that has come
to be associated with the names of Lanz and Bétancourt.</p>

<p>Gaspard Monge (1746-1818), who while a draftsman at Mézières originated the
methods of descriptive geometry, came to the Ecole Polytechnique as professor of
mathematics upon its founding in 1794, the second year of the French Republic.
According to Jean Nicolas Pierre Hachette (1769-1834), who was junior to Monge
in the department of descriptive geometry, Monge planned to give a two-months'
course devoted to the elements of machines. Having barely gotten his department
under way, however, Monge became involved in Napoleon's ambitious scientific
mission to Egypt and, taking leave of his family and his students, embarked for
the distant shores.</p>

<p>&quot;Being left in charge,&quot; wrote Hachette, &quot;I prepared the course of which
Monge
had given only the first idea, and I pursued the study of machines in order to
analyze and classify them, and to relate geometrical and mechanical principles
to their construction.&quot; Changes of curriculum delayed introduction of the course
until 1806, and not until 1811 was his textbook ready, but the outline of his
ideas was presented to his classes in chart form (fig. 28). This chart was the
first of the widely popular synoptical tables of mechanical movements.<a name="FNanchor_62_63" id="FNanchor_62_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_63" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>From Jean N. P. Hachette, <em>Traité Élémentaire des Machines</em> (Paris,

<p>Hachette classified all mechanisms by considering the conversion of one
motion into another. His elementary motions were continuous circular,
alternating circular, continuous rectilinear, and alternating rectilinear.
Combining one motion with another&#8212;for example, a treadle and crank converted
alternating circular to continuous circular motion&#8212;he devised a system that
supplied a frame of reference for the study of mechanisms. In the U.S. Military
Academy at West Point, Hachette's treatise, in the original French, was used as
a textbook in 1824, and perhaps earlier.<a name="FNanchor_63_64" id="FNanchor_63_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_64" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

	when he visited France in 1816 to observe the education of the French army
	cadets. Thayer's visit resulted in his adopting the philosophy of the Ecole

	incidentally, in his inclusion of Hachette's course in the Academy's
	curriculum (U.S. Congress, <em>American State Papers</em>, Washington, 1832-1861,
	Class v, Military Affairs, vol. 2, p. 661: Sidney Forman, <em>West Point</em>, New

	77, Office, Chief of Engineers, Boxes 1 and 6) pertaining to the U.S.
	Military Academy of this period, but I found no mention of kinematics in
	this collection.</p></div>

<p>Lanz and Bétancourt, scholars from Spain at the Ecole Polytechnique, plugged
some of the gaps in Hachette's system by adding continuous and alternating
curvilinear motion, which doubled the number of combinations to be treated, but
the advance of their work over that of Hachette was one of degree rather than of
kind.<a name="FNanchor_64_65" id="FNanchor_64_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_65" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

monumental, nine-volume <em>Traité complet de méchanique appliquée aux arts</em>,
caused a bifurcation of the structure built upon Hachette's foundation of
classification when he introduced six orders of machine elements and subdivided
these into classes and species. His six orders were <em>récepteurs</em> (receivers of
motion from the prime mover), <em>communicateurs</em>, <em>modificateurs</em> (modifiers of
velocity), <em>supports</em> (e.g., bearings), <em>regulateurs</em> (e.g., governors), and

needed more knowledge than his undergraduate work at the Ecole Polytechnique was
likely to give him. Although he embraced a part of Borgnis' approach, adopting
<em>récepteurs</em>, <em>communicateurs</em>, and <em>operateurs</em>, Coriolis indicated by the
title of his book that he was more concerned with forces than with relative
displacements. However, the attractively simple three-element scheme of Coriolis

<p>Acting upon Ampère's clear exposition of the province of kinematics and
excluding, as Ampère had done, the consideration of forces, an Englishman,
Robert Willis, made the next giant stride forward in the analysis of mechanisms.
Willis was 37 years old in 1837 when he was appointed professor of natural and
experimental philosophy at Cambridge. In the same year Professor Willis&#8212;a man of
prodigious energy and industry and an authority on archeology and architectural
history as well as mechanisms&#8212;read his important paper &quot;On the Teeth of Wheels&quot;
before the Institution of Civil Engineers<a name="FNanchor_70_71" id="FNanchor_70_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_71" class="fnanchor">[[70]</a>
and commenced at Cambridge his lectures on kinematics of mechanisms that
culminated in his 1841 book <em>Principles of Mechanism</em>.<a name="FNanchor_71_72" id="FNanchor_71_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_72" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

	The book is interleaved, and it contains notes made by Willis from time to

<p>It seemed clear to Willis that the problem of devising a mechanism for a
given purpose ought to be attacked systematically, perhaps mathematically, in
order to determine &quot;all the forms and arrangements that are applicable to the
desired purpose,&quot; from which the designer might select the simplest or most
suitable combination. &quot;At present,&quot; he wrote, &quot;questions of this kind can only
be solved by that species of intuition which long familiarity with a subject
usually confers upon experienced persons, but which they are totally unable to
communicate to others.&quot;</p>

<p>In analyzing the process by which a machine was designed, Willis observed:
&quot;When the mind of a mechanician is occupied with the contrivance of a machine,
he must wait until, in the midst of his meditations, some happy combination
presents itself to his mind which may answer his purpose.&quot; He ventured the
opinion that at this stage of the design process &quot;the motions of the machine are
the principal subject of contemplation, rather than the forces applied to it, or
the work it has to do.&quot; Therefore he was prepared to adopt without reservation
Ampère's view of kinematics, and, if possible, to make the science useful to
engineers by stating principles that could be applied without having to fit the
problem at hand into the framework of the systems of classification and
description that had gone before. He appraised the &quot;celebrated system&quot; of Lanz
and Bétancourt as &quot;a merely popular arrangement, notwithstanding the apparently
scientific simplicity of the scheme.&quot; He rejected this scheme because &quot;no
attempt is made to subject the motions to calculation, or to reduce these laws
to general formulas, for which indeed the system is totally unfitted.&quot;</p>

<p>Borgnis had done a better job, Willis thought, in actually describing
machinery, with his &quot;orders&quot; based upon the functions of machine elements or
mechanisms within the machine, but again there was no means suggested by which
the kinematics of mechanisms could be systematically investigated.</p>

<p>Although Willis commenced his treatise with yet another &quot;synoptical table of
the elementary combinations of pure mechanism,&quot; his view shifted quickly from
description to analysis. He was consistent in his pursuit of analytical methods
for &quot;pure mechanism,&quot; eschewing any excursions into the realm of forces and
absolute velocities. He grasped the important concept of relative displacements
of machine elements, and based his treatment upon &quot;the proportions and relations
between the velocities and directions of the pieces, and not upon their actual
and separate motions.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_72_73" id="FNanchor_72_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_73" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p>That he did not succeed in developing the &quot;formulas&quot; that would enable the
student to determine &quot;all the forms and arrangements that are applicable to the
desired purpose&quot;&#8212;that he did not present a rational approach to synthesis&#8212;is not
to be wondered at. Well over a century later we still are nibbling at the
fringes of the problem. Willis did, nonetheless, give the thoughtful reader a
glimpse of the most powerful tool for kinematic synthesis that has yet been
devised; namely, kinematic analysis, in which the argument is confined to the
relative displacements of points on links of a mechanism, and through which the
designer may grasp the nature of the means at his disposal for the solution of
any particular problem.</p>

<p>As remarked by Reuleaux a generation later, there was much in Professor
Willis's book that was wrong, but it was an original, thoughtful work that
departed in spirit if not always in method from its predecessors. <em>Principles
of Mechanism</em> was a prominent landmark along the road to a rational discipline of
machine-kinematics.</p>

<p>A phenomenal engineer of the 19th century was the Scottish professor of civil
engineering at the University of Glasgow, William John MacQuorn Rankine.
Although he was at the University for only 17 years&#8212;he died at the age of 52, in
1872&#8212;he turned out during that time four thick manuals on such diverse subjects
as civil engineering, ship-building, thermodynamics, and machinery and
mill-work, in addition to literally hundreds of papers, articles, and notes for
scientific journals and the technical press. Endowed with apparently boundless
energy, he found time from his studies to command a battalion of rifle
volunteers and to compose and sing comic and patriotic songs. His manuals, often
used as textbooks, were widely circulated and went through many editions.
Rankine's work had a profound effect upon the practice of engineering by setting
out principles in a form that could be grasped by people who were dismayed by
the treatment usually found in the learned journals.</p>

<p>When Rankine's book titled <em>A Manual of Machinery and Millwork</em> was published
in 1869 it was accurately characterized by a reviewer as &quot;dealing with the
<em>principles</em> of machinery and millworks, and as such it is entirely distinct
from [other works on the same subject] which treat more of the practical
applications of such principles than of the principles themselves.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_73_74" id="FNanchor_73_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_74" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

	[73]</span></a>  <em>Engineering</em>, London, August 13, 1869, vol. 8, p. 111.</p></div>

<p>Rankine borrowed what appeared useful from Willis' <em>Principles of
Mechanism</em>
and from other sources. His treatment of kinematics was not as closely reasoned
as the later treatises of Reuleaux and Kennedy, which will be considered below.
Rankine did, however, for the first time show the utility of instant centers in
velocity analysis, although he made use only of the instant centers involving
the fixed link of a linkage. Like others before him, he considered the fixed
link of a mechanism as something quite different from the movable links, and he
did not perceive the possibilities opened up by determining the instant center
of two movable links.</p>

<p>Many other books dealing with mechanisms were published during the middle
third of the century, but none of them had a discernible influence upon the
advance of kinematical ideas.<a name="FNanchor_74_75" id="FNanchor_74_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_75" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>
The center of inquiry had by the 1860's shifted from France to Germany. Only by
scattered individuals in England, Italy, and France was there any impatience
with the well-established, general understanding of the machine-building art.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_74_75" id="Footnote_74_75"></a><a href="#FNanchor_74_75"><span class="label">
	[74]</span></a> Several such books are referred to by Reuleaux, <em>op. cit.</em>
	(footnote 68), pp. 12-16.</p></div>

<p>In Germany, on the other hand, there was a surge of industrial activity that
attracted some very able men to the problems of how machines ought to be built.
Among the first of these was Ferdinand Redtenbacher (1809-1863), professor of
mechanical engineering in the polytechnic school in Karlsruhe, not far from
Heidelberg. Redtenbacher, although he despaired of the possibility of finding a
&quot;true system on which to base the study of mechanisms,&quot; was nevertheless a
factor in the development of such a system. He had young Franz Reuleaux in his
classes for two years, from 1850. During that time the older man's commanding
presence, his ability as a lecturer, and his infectious impatience with the
existing order influenced Reuleaux to follow the scholar's trail that led him to
eminence as an authority of the first rank.<a name="FNanchor_75_76" id="FNanchor_75_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_76" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>Before he was 25 years old Franz Reuleaux published, in collaboration with a
classmate, a textbook whose translated title would be <em>Constructive Lessons

His several years in the workshop, before and after coming under Redtenbacher's
influence, gave his works a practical flavor, simple and direct. According to
one observer, Reuleaux's book exhibited &quot;a recognition of the claims of practice
such as Englishmen do not generally associate with the writings of a German
scientific professor.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_77_78" id="FNanchor_77_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_78" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p>Reuleaux's original ideas on kinematics, which are responsible for the way in
which we look at mechanisms today, were sufficiently formed in 1864 for him to
lecture upon them.<a name="FNanchor_78_79" id="FNanchor_78_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_79" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>
Starting in 1871, he published his findings serially in the publication of the
Verein zur Beförderung des Gewerbefleisses in Preussen (Society for the
Advancement of Industry in Prussia), of which he was editor. In 1875 these
articles were brought together in the book that established his
fame&#8212;<em>Theoretische Kinematik....</em><a name="FNanchor_79_80" id="FNanchor_79_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_80" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p>In the introduction of this book, Reuleaux wrote:</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">In the development of every exact science, its
substance having</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">grown sufficiently to make generalization

<p>Reuleaux's confidence that it would be his own work that would bring order
out of confusion was well founded. His book had already been translated into
Italian and was being translated into French when, only a year after its
publication, it was presented by Prof. Alexander B. W. Kennedy in English
translation.<a name="FNanchor_81_82" id="FNanchor_81_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_82" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>The book was enthusiastically reviewed by the weekly London journal
<em>Engineering</em>,<a name="FNanchor_82_83" id="FNanchor_82_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_83" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>
and it was given lengthy notice by the rival journal, <em>The Engineer</em>. The editor
of <em>The Engineer</em> thought that the mechanician would find in it many new ideas,
that he would be &quot;taught to detect hitherto hidden resemblances, and that he
must part&#8212;reluctantly, perhaps&#8212;with many of his old notions.&quot; &quot;But,&quot; added the
editor with considerable justice, &quot;that he [the mechanician] would suddenly
recognize in Professor Reuleaux's 'kinematic notation,' 'analysis,' and
'synthesis,' the long-felt want of his professional existence we do not for a
moment believe.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_83_84" id="FNanchor_83_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_84" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>
Indeed, the fresh and sharp ideas of Reuleaux were somewhat clouded by a long
(600-page) presentation; and his kinematic notation, which required another
attempt at classification, did not simplify the presentation of radically new
ideas.<a name="FNanchor_84_85" id="FNanchor_84_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_85" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

Institution of Civil Engineers</em> (1907, vol. 167, frontispiece).</p>

<p>Nevertheless, no earlier author had seen the problem of kinematic analysis so
clearly or had introduced so much that was fresh, new, and of lasting value.</p>

<p>Reuleaux was first to state the concept of the pair; by his concept of the
expansion of pairs he was able to show similarities in mechanisms that had no
apparent relation. He was first to recognize that the fixed link of a mechanism
was kinematically the same as the movable links. This led him to the important
notion of inversion of linkages, fixing successively the various links and thus
changing the function of the mechanism. He devoted 40 pages to showing, with
obvious delight, the kinematic identity of one design after another of rotary
steam engines, demolishing for all time the fond hopes of ingenious but
ill-informed inventors who think that improvements and advances in mechanism
design consist in contortion and complexity.</p>

<p>The chapter on synthesis was likewise fresh, but it consisted of a
discussion, not a system; and Reuleaux stressed the idea that I have mentioned
above in connection with Willis' book, that synthesis will be successful in
proportion to the designer's understanding and appreciation of analysis.
Reuleaux tried to put the designer on the right track by showing him clearly
&quot;the essential simplicity of the means with which we have to work&quot; and by
demonstrating to him &quot;that the many things which have to be done can be done
with but few means, and that the principles underlying them all lie clearly
before us.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_85_86" id="FNanchor_85_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_86" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p>It remained for Sir Alexander Blackie William Kennedy (1847-1928) and Robert
Henry Smith (1852-1916) to add to Reuleaux's work the elements that would give
kinematic analysis essentially its modern shape.</p>

<p>Kennedy, the translator of Reuleaux's book, became professor of engineering
at the University College in London in 1874, and eventually served as president
both of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers and of the Institution of Civil
Engineers. Smith, who had taught in the Imperial University of Japan, was
professor of engineering at Mason College, now a part of Birmingham University,
in England.</p>

<p>While Reuleaux had used instant centers almost exclusively for the
construction of centrodes (paths of successive positions of an instant center),
Professor Kennedy recognized that instant centers might be used in velocity
analysis. His book, <em>Mechanics of Machinery</em>, was published in 1886 (&quot;partly
through pressure of work and partly through ill-health, this book appears only
now&quot;). In it he developed the law of three centers, now known as Kennedy's
theorem. He noted that his law of three centers &quot;was first given, I believe, by
Aronhold, although its previous publication was unknown to me until some years
after I had given it in my lectures.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_86_87" id="FNanchor_86_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_87" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>
In fact, the law had been published by Siegfried Heinrich Aronhold (1819-1884)
in his &quot;Outline of Kinematic Geometry,&quot; which appeared in 1872 alongside
Reuleaux's series in the journal that Reuleaux edited. Apparently Reuleaux did
not perceive its particular significance at that time.<a name="FNanchor_87_88" id="FNanchor_87_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_88" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p>Kennedy, after locating instant centers, determined velocities by calculation
and accelerations by graphical differentiation of velocities, and he noted in
his preface that he had been unable, for a variety of reasons, to make use in
his book of Smith's recent work. Professor Kennedy at least was aware of Smith's
surprisingly advanced ideas, which seem to have been generally ignored by
Americans and Englishmen alike.</p>

<p>Professor Smith, in a paper before the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1885,
stated clearly the ideas and methods for construction of velocity and
acceleration diagrams of linkages.<a name="FNanchor_88_89" id="FNanchor_88_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_89" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>

so long a time.</p>

<p>By 1885 nearly all the tools for modern kinematic analysis had been forged.
Before discussing subsequent developments in analysis and synthesis, however, it
will be profitable to inquire what the mechanician&#8212;designer and builder of
machines&#8212;was doing while all of this intellectual effort was being expended.</p>


<h3><a name="Mechanicians_and_Mechanisms">Mechanicians and Mechanisms</a></h3>

<p>While the inductive process of recognizing and stating true principles of the
kinematics of mechanisms was proceeding through three generations of French,
English, and finally German scholars, the actual design of mechanisms went ahead
with scant regard for what the scholars were doing and saying.</p>

<p>After the demonstration by Boulton and Watt that large mechanisms could be
wrought with sufficient precision to be useful, the English tool builders
Maudslay, Roberts, Clement, Nasmyth, and Whitworth developed machine tools of
increasing size and truth. The design of other machinery kept pace
with&#8212;sometimes just behind, sometimes just ahead of&#8212;the capacity and capability
of machine tools. In general, there was an increasing sophistication of
mechanisms that could only be accounted for by an increase of information with
which the individual designer could start.</p>

<p>Reuleaux pointed out in 1875 that the &quot;almost feverish progress made in the
regions of technical work&quot; was &quot;not a consequence of any increased capacity for
intellectual action in the race, but only the perfecting and extending of the
tools with which the intellect works.&quot; These tools, he said, &quot;have increased in
number just like those in the modern mechanical workshop&#8212;the men who work them
remain the same.&quot; Reuleaux went on to say that the theory and practice of
machine-kinematics had &quot;carried on a separate existence side by side.&quot; The
reason for this failure to apply theory to practice, and vice versa, must be
sought in the defects of the theory, he thought, because &quot;the mechanisms
themselves have been quietly developed in practical machine-design, by invention
and improvement, regardless of whether or not they were accorded any direct and
proper theoretical recognition.&quot; He pointed out that the theories had thus far
&quot;furnished no new mechanisms.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_89_90" id="FNanchor_89_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_90" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_89_90" id="Footnote_89_90"></a><a href="#FNanchor_89_90"><span class="label">
	[89]</span></a> Reuleaux, <em>op. cit.</em> (footnote 68), p. 8.</p></div>

<p>It is reasonable, therefore, to ask what was responsible for the appearance
of new mechanisms, and then to see what sort of mechanisms had their origins in
this period.</p>

<p>It is immediately evident to a designer that the progress in mechanisms came
about through the spread of knowledge of what had already been done; but
designers of the last century had neither the leisure nor means to be constantly
visiting other workshops, near and far, to observe and study the latest
developments. In the 1800's, as now, word must in the main be spread by the
printed page.</p>

<p>Hachette's chart (fig. 28) had set the pattern for display of mechanical
contrivances in practical journals and in the large number of mechanical
dictionaries that were compiled to meet an apparent demand for such information.
It is a little surprising, however, to find how persistent were some of
Hachette's ideas that could only have come from the uppermost superficial layer
of his cranium. See, for example, his &quot;anchored ferryboat&quot; (fig. 34). This
device, employed by Hachette to show conversion of continuous rectilinear motion
into alternating circular motion, appeared in one publication after another
throughout the 19th century. As late as 1903 the ferryboat was still anchored in
Hiscox's <em>Mechanical Movements</em>, although the tide had changed (fig. 35).<a name="FNanchor_90_91" id="FNanchor_90_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_91" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>During the upsurge of the Lyceum&#8212;or working-man's institute&#8212;movement in the
1820's, Jacob Bigelow, Rumford professor of applied science at Harvard
University, gave his popular lectures on the &quot;Elements of Technology&quot; before
capacity audiences in Boston. In preparing his lecture on the elements of
machinery, Bigelow used as his authorities Hachette, Lanz and Bétancourt, and
Olinthus Gregory's mechanical dictionary, an English work in which Hachette's
classification scheme was copied and his chart reproduced.<a name="FNanchor_91_92" id="FNanchor_91_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_92" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>Many patent journals and other mechanical periodicals concerned with
mechanics were available in English from the beginning of the 19th century, but
few of them found their way into the hands of American mechanicians until after
1820. Oliver Evans (1755-1819) had much to say about &quot;the difficulties inventive
mechanics labored under for want of published records of what had preceded them,
and for works of reference to help the beginner.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_98_99" id="FNanchor_98_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_99" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>
In 1817 the <em>North American Review</em> also remarked upon the scarcity of

<p>The <em>Scientific American</em>, which appeared in 1845 as a patent journal edited
by the patent promoter Rufus Porter, carried almost from its beginning a column
or so entitled &quot;Mechanical Movements,&quot; in which one or two mechanisms&#8212;borrowed
from an English work that had borrowed from a French work&#8212;were illustrated and
explained. The <em>American Artisan</em> began a similar series in 1864, and in 1868 it
published a compilation of the series as <em>Five Hundred and Seven Mechanical
Movements</em>, &quot;embracing all those which are most important in dynamics,
hydraulics, hydrostatics, pneumatics, steam engines ... and miscellaneous
machinery.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_100_101" id="FNanchor_100_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_101" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>

<p>There was an interesting class of United States patents called &quot;Mechanical
Movements&quot; that comprised scores of patents issued throughout the middle decades
of the 19th century. A sampling of these patents shows that while some were for
devices used in particular machines&#8212;such as a ratchet device for a numbering
machine, a locking index for unmaking machinery, and a few gear trains&#8212;the
great majority were for converting reciprocating motion to rotary motion. Even a
cursory examination of these patents reveals an appalling absence of sound
mechanical sense, and many of them appear to be attempts at &quot;perpetual motion,&quot;
in spite of an occasional disclaimer of such intent.</p>

<p>Typical of many of these patented devices was a linkage for &quot;multiplying&quot; the
motion of a flywheel, proposed in 1841 by Charles Johnson of Amity, Illinois
(fig. 37). &quot;It is not pretended that there is any actual gain of power,&quot; wrote
Mr. Johnson; and probably he meant it. The avowed purpose of his linkage was to
increase the speed of a flywheel and thus decrease its size.<a name="FNanchor_103_104" id="FNanchor_103_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_104" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

flywheel to make two revolutions for each double-stroke of the engine piston rod
B. From U.S. Patent 2295, October 11, 1841.</p>

<p>An Englishman who a few years earlier had invented a &quot;new Motion&quot; had claimed
that his device would supersede the &quot;ordinary crank in steam engines,&quot; the beam,
parallel motion, and &quot;external flywheel,&quot; reduce friction, neutralize &quot;all extra
contending power,&quot; and leave nothing for the piston to do &quot;but the work intended
to be done.&quot;</p>

<p>A correspondent of the <em>Repertory of Patent Inventions</em> made short work of
this device: &quot;There is hardly one assertion that can be supported by proof,&quot; he
wrote, &quot;and most of them are palpable misstatements.&quot; The writer attacked &quot;the
'beetle impetus wheel,' which he [the inventor] thinks us all so beetle-headed,
as not to perceive to be a flywheel,&quot; and concluded with the statement: &quot;In
short the whole production evinces gross ignorance either of machinery, if the
patentee really believed what he asserted, or of mankind, if he did not.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_104_105" id="FNanchor_104_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_105" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p>Although many of the mechanisms for which patents were taken out were
designed by persons who would make no use of the principles involved even if
such principles could at that time have been clearly stated, it is a regrettable
fact that worthless mechanisms often got as much space as sound ones in patent
journals, and objections such as the one above were infrequent. The slanted
information thus conveyed to the young mechanician, who was just accumulating
his first kinematic repertory, was at times sadly misleading.</p>

<p>From even this sketchy outline of the literature on the subject, it should be
fairly evident that there has been available to the mechanician an enormous
quantity of information about mechanical linkages and other devices. Whatever
one may think of the quality of the literature, it has undoubtedly had influence
not only in supplying designers with information but in forming a tradition of
how one ought to supply the background that will enable the mind to assemble and
synthesize the necessary mechanism for a given purpose.<a name="FNanchor_105_106" id="FNanchor_105_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_106" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

	listed in the selected references at the end of this paper.</p></div>

<p>Some of the mechanisms that have been given names&#8212;such as the Watt
straight-line linkage and the Geneva stop&#8212;have appeared in textbook after
textbook. Their only excuse for being seems to be that the authors must include
them or risk censure by colleagues. Such mechanisms are more interesting to a
reader, certainly, when he has some idea of what the name has to do with the
mechanism, and who originated it. One such mechanism is the drag link.</p>

<p>After I had learned of the drag link (as most American engineering students
do), I wondered for awhile, and eventually despaired of making any sense out of
the term. What, I wanted to know, was being dragged? Recently, in Nicholson's
<em>Operative Mechanic and British Machinist</em> (1826), I ran across the sketch
reproduced here as figure 38. This figure, explained Mr. Nicholson (in vol. 1,
p. 32) &quot;represents the coupling link used by Messrs. Boulton and Watt in their
portable steam engines. <strong>A</strong>, a strong iron pin, projecting from one of the arms of
the fly-wheel <strong>B</strong>; <strong>D</strong>, a crank connected with the shaft
<strong>C</strong>; and <strong>E</strong>, a link to couple
the pin <strong>A</strong> and the crank <strong>D</strong> together, so the motion may be communicated to the
shaft <strong>C</strong>.&quot; So the drag link was actually a link of a coupling. Nothing could be
more logical. A drag link mechanism now makes sense to me.</p>

1826, vol. I, pl. 5).</p>

<p>Directly related to the drag link coupling were the patents of John Oldham
(1779-1840), an Irish engineer who is remembered mainly for the coupling that
bears his name (fig. 39). His three patents, which were for various forms of
steamboat feathering paddle wheels, involved linkages kinematically similar to
the drag link coupling, although it is quite unlikely that Oldham recognized the
similarity. However, for his well-known coupling, which employs an inversion of
the elliptical trammel mechanism, I have found no evidence of a patent. Probably
it was part of the machinery that he designed for the Bank of Ireland's printing
house, of which Oldham was manager for many years. &quot;Mr. Oldham and his beautiful
system&quot; were brought to the Bank of England in 1836, where Oldham remained until
his death in 1840.<a name="FNanchor_106_107" id="FNanchor_106_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_107" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

	(October 10, 1817), 4429 (January 15, 1820), and 5445 (February 1, 1827).
	Robert Willis (<em>op. cit.</em>  footnote 21, p. 167) noticed the existence of the
	coupling. Drawings or descriptions of the banknote machinery apparently have
	not been published though they probably still exist in the banks' archives.

	be uninteresting to delineate.&quot;</p></div>

<p>The Geneva stop mechanism (fig. 40) was properly described by Willis as a
device to permit less than a full revolution of the star wheel and thus to
prevent overwinding of a watch spring. It was called Geneva stop because it was
used in Geneva watches. The Geneva wheel mechanism, which permits full rotation
of the star wheel and which is frequently used for intermittent drives, was
improperly called a Geneva stop in a recent textbook probably because the
logical origin of the term had been lost.</p>

<p>The name for the Scotch yoke seems to be of fairly recent origin, the linkage
being called by a Scotsman in 1869 a &quot;crank and slot-headed sliding rod&quot; (fig.
41). I suppose that it is now known as a Scotch yoke because, in America at
least, a &quot;Scotch&quot; was a slotted bar that was slipped under a collar on a string
of well-drilling tools to support them while a section was being added (fig.
42).</p>

<p>It was surprising to me to find that the Ackermann steering linkage, used
today on most automobiles, was patented in 1818 when Detroit was still a
frontier town.<a name="FNanchor_107_108" id="FNanchor_107_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_108" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>
Furthermore, the man who took out the patent described himself as Rudolph
Ackermann, publisher and printseller. I thought I had the necessary clue to the
linkage's origin when I noticed that the first English translation of the Lanz
and Bétancourt treatise was published by Ackermann, but the connection finally
proved to be more logical, if less direct. Ackermann (1764-1834), son of a
Bavarian coach builder, had spent a number of years designing coaches for
English gentlemen in London, where he made his home. One of his more notable
commissions was for the design of Admiral Nelson's funeral car in 1805. The
Ackermann steering linkage was not actually Ackermann's invention, although he
took out the British patent in his name and promoted the introduction of the
running gear of which the linkage was a part (fig. 43). The actual inventor was
Ackermann's friend George Lankensperger of Munich, coachmaker to the King of
Bavaria. The advantage of being able to turn a carriage around in a limited area
without danger of oversetting was immediately obvious, and while there was
considerable opposition by English coachmakers to an innovation for which a
premium had to be paid, the invention soon &quot;made its way from its own intrinsic
merit,&quot; as Ackermann predicted it would.<a name="FNanchor_108_109" id="FNanchor_108_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_109" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p>Engineering colleges in the United States were occupied until the late 1940's
with extending, refining, and sharpening the tools of analysis that had been
suggested by Willis, Rankine, Reuleaux, Kennedy, and Smith. The actual practice
of kinematic synthesis went on apace, but designers often declined such help as
the analytical methods might give them and there was little exchange of ideas
between scholars and practitioners.</p>

<p>The capability and precision of machine tools were greatly enhanced during
this period, although, with the exception of the centerless grinder, no
significant new types of tools appeared. The machines that were made with
machine tools increased in complexity and, with the introduction of ideas that
made mass production of complex mechanical products economically feasible, there
was an accelerating increase in quantity. The adoption of standards for all
sorts of component parts also had an important bearing upon the ability of a
designer economically to produce mechanisms that operated very nearly as he
hoped they would.</p>

<p>The study of kinematics has been considered for nearly 80 years as a
necessary part of the mechanical engineer's training, as the dozens of textbooks
that have been published over the years make amply clear. Until recently,
however, one would look in vain for original work in America in the analysis or
rational synthesis of mechanisms.</p>

<p>One of the very earliest American textbooks of kinematics was the 1883 work
of Charles W. MacCord (1836-1915), who had been appointed professor of
mechanical drawing at Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken after serving
John Ericsson, designer of the <em>Monitor</em>, as chief draftsman during the Civil
War.<a name="FNanchor_110_111" id="FNanchor_110_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_111" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>
Based upon the findings of Willis and Rankine, MacCord's <em>Kinematics</em> came too
early to be influenced by Kennedy's improvements upon Reuleaux's work.</p>

	in <em>Morton Memorial: A History of the Stevens Institute of Technology</em>,

<p>When the faculty at Washington University in St. Louis introduced in 1885 a
curriculum in &quot;dynamic engineering,&quot; reflecting a dissatisfaction with the
traditional branches of engineering, kinematics was a senior subject and was
taught from Rankine's <em>Machinery and Millwork</em>.<a name="FNanchor_111_112" id="FNanchor_111_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_112" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

	Engineers</em>, 1885-1886, vol. 7, p. 757.</p></div>

<p>At Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Peter Schwamb, professor of machine
design, put together in 1885 a set of printed notes on the kinematics of
mechanisms, based on Reuleaux's and Rankine's works. Out of these notes grew one
of the most durable of American textbooks, first published in 1904.<a name="FNanchor_112_113" id="FNanchor_112_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_113" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>
In the first edition of this work, acceleration was mentioned only once in
passing (on p. 4). Velocities in linkages were determined by orthogonal
components transferred from link to link. Instant centers were used only to
determine velocities of various points on the same link. Angular velocity ratios
were frequently noted. In the third edition, published in 1921, linear and
angular accelerations were defined, but no acceleration analyses were made.
Velocity analyses were altered without essential change. The fourth edition
(1930) was essentially unchanged from the previous one. Treatment of velocity
analysis was improved in the fifth edition (1938) and acceleration analysis was
added. A sixth edition, further revised by Prof. V. L. Doughtie of the
University of Texas, appeared in 1947.</p>

<p>Before 1900, several other books on mechanisms had been published, and all
followed one or another of the patterns of their predecessors. Professors Woods
and Stahl, at the Universities of Illinois and Purdue, respectively, who
published their <em>Elementary Mechanism</em> in 1885, said in their preface what has
been said by many other American authors and what should have been said by many
more. &quot;We make little claim to originality of the subject-matter,&quot; wrote Woods
and Stahl, &quot;free use having been made of all available matter on the subject....
Our claim to consideration is based almost entirely on the manner in which the
subject has been presented.&quot; Not content with this disclaimer, they continued:
&quot;There is, in fact, very little room for such originality, the ground having
been almost completely covered by previous writers.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_113_114" id="FNanchor_113_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_114" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<p>The similarity and aridity of kinematics textbooks in this country from
around 1910 are most striking. The generation of textbook writers following
MacCord, Woods and Stahl, Barr of Cornell, Robinson of Ohio State, and Schwamb
and Merrill managed to squeeze out any remaining juice in the subject, and the
dessication and sterilization of textbooks was nearly complete when my
generation used them in the 1930's. Kinematics was then, in more than one
school, very nearly as it was characterized by an observer in 1942&#8212;&quot;on an
intellectual par with mechanical drafting.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_114_115" id="FNanchor_114_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_115" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>
I can recall my own naïve belief that a textbook contained all that was known of
the subject; and I was not disabused of my belief by my own textbook or by my
teacher. I think I detect in several recent books a fresh, less final, and less
tidy treatment of the kinematics of mechanisms, but I would yet recommend that
anyone who thinks of writing a textbook take time to review, carefully and at
first hand, not only the desk copies of books that he has accumulated but a
score or more of earlier works, covering the last century at least. Such a study
should result in a better appreciation of what constitutes a contribution to
knowledge and what constitutes merely the ringing of another change.</p>

<p>The author of the contentious article that appeared in <em>Mechanical
Engineering</em> in 1942 under the title &quot;What is Wrong with Kinematics and
Mechanisms?&quot; made several pronouncements that were questioned by various
readers, but his remarks on the meagerness of the college courses of kinematics
and the &quot;curious fact&quot; that the textbooks &quot;are all strangely similar in their
incompleteness&quot; went unchallenged and were, in fact, quite timely.<a name="FNanchor_115_116" id="FNanchor_115_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_116" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

<p>It appears that in the early 1940's the general classroom treatment of
accelerations was at a level well below the existing knowledge of the subject,
for in a series of articles by two teachers at Purdue attention was called to
the serious consequences of errors in acceleration analysis occasioned by
omitting the Coriolis component.<a name="FNanchor_116_117" id="FNanchor_116_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_117" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>
These authors were reversing a trend that had been given impetus by an article
written in 1920 by one of their predecessors, Henry N. Bonis. The earlier
article, appearing in a practical-and-proud-of-it technical magazine,
demonstrated how the acceleration of a point on a flywheel governor might be
determined &quot;without the use of the fictitious acceleration of Coriolis.&quot; The
author's analysis was right enough, and he closed his article with the
unimpeachable statement that &quot;it is better psychologically for the student and
practically for the engineer to understand the fundamentals thoroughly than to
use a complex formula that may be misapplied.&quot; However, many readers undoubtedly
read only the lead paragraph, sagely nodded their heads when they reached the
word &quot;fictitious,&quot; which confirmed their half-formed conviction that anything as
abstruse as the Coriolis component could have no bearing upon a practical
problem, and turned the page to the &quot;practical kinks&quot; section.<a name="FNanchor_117_118" id="FNanchor_117_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_118" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<p>Less than 20 years ago one might have read in <em>Mechanical Engineering</em> that
&quot;Practical machinery does not originate in mathematical formulas nor in
beautiful vector diagrams.&quot; While this remark was in a letter evoked by an
article, and was not a reflection of editorial policy, it was nevertheless
representative of an element in the American tradition of engineering. The
unconscious arrogance that is displayed in this statement of the &quot;practical&quot;
designer's creed is giving way to recognition of the value of scholarly work.
Lest the scholar develop arrogance of another sort, however, it is well to hear
the author of the statement out. &quot;A drafting machine is a useful tool,&quot; he
wrote. &quot;It is not a substitute for a draftsman.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_118_119" id="FNanchor_118_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_119" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<p>The scholarly interest in a subject is fairly represented by the papers that
are published in the transactions of professional societies and, more recently,
by original papers that appear in specialized magazines. From 1900 to 1930 there
were few papers on mechanisms, and most of those that did appear were concerned
with descriptions of new &quot;mechanical motions.&quot; In the 1930's the number of
papers reported in <em>Engineering Index</em> increased sharply, but only because the
editors had begun to include foreign-language listings.</p>

<p>There has been in Germany a thread of continuity in the kinematics of
mechanisms since the time of Reuleaux. While most of the work has had to do with
analysis, the teasing question of synthesis that Reuleaux raised in his work has
never been ignored. The developments in Germany and elsewhere have been ably
reviewed by others,<a name="FNanchor_119_120" id="FNanchor_119_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_120" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>
and it is only to be noted here that two of the German papers, published in 1939
in <em>Maschinenbau</em>, appear to have been the sparks for the conflagration that
still is increasing in extent and intensity. According to summaries in <em>
Engineering Index</em>, R. Kraus, writing on the synthesis of the double-crank
mechanism, drew fire from the Russian Z. S. Bloch, who, in 1940, discussed
critically Kraus's articles and proceeded to give the outline of the &quot;correct
analysis of the problem&quot; and a general numerical solution for the synthesis of
&quot;any four-bar linkage.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_120_121" id="FNanchor_120_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_121" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>
Russian work in mechanisms, dating back to Chebyshev and following the
&quot;Chebyshev theory of synthesis&quot; in which algebraic methods are used to determine
paths of minimum deviation from a given curve, has also been reviewed elsewhere,<a name="FNanchor_121_122" id="FNanchor_121_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_122" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>
and I can add nothing of value.</p>

<p>When, after World War II, some of the possibilities of kinematic synthesis
were recognized in the United States, a few perceptive teachers fanned the
tinder into an open flame.</p>

<p>The first publication of note in this country on the synthesis of linkages
was a practical one, but in conception and undertaking it was a bold enterprise.
In a book by John A. Hrones and G. L. Nelson, <em>Analysis of the Four Bar
Linkage</em>
(1951), the four-bar crank-and-rocker mechanism was exhaustively analyzed
mechanically and the results were presented graphically. This work was faintly
praised by a Dutch scholar, O. Bottema, who observed that the &quot;complicated
analytical theory of the three-bar [sic] curve has undoubtedly kept the engineer
from using it&quot; and who went on to say that &quot;we fully understand the publication
of an atlas by Hrones and Nelson containing thousands of trajectories which must
be very useful in many design problems.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_122_123" id="FNanchor_122_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_123" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>
Nevertheless, the authors furnished designers with a tool that could be readily,
almost instantly, understood (fig. 45), and the atlas has enjoyed wide
circulation.<a name="FNanchor_123_124" id="FNanchor_123_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_124" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>
The idea of a geometrical approach to synthesis has been exploited by others in
more recent publications,<a name="FNanchor_124_125" id="FNanchor_124_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_125" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>
and it is likely that many more variations on this theme will appear.</p>

<p>The proper role of rational methods in the synthesis of mechanisms is not yet
clear. &quot;While we may talk about kinematic synthesis,&quot; wrote two of today's
leaders in the field, &quot;we are really talking about a hope for the future rather
than a great reality of the present.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_126_127" id="FNanchor_126_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_127" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>
When the mental equipment and the enthusiasm of scholars who are devoting their
time to the problems of kinematic synthesis are considered, however, it is
difficult to see how important new ideas can fail to be produced.</p>

<p>An annual Conference on Mechanisms, sponsored by Purdue University and
<em>Machine Design</em>, was inaugurated in 1953 and has met with a lively response.
Among other manifestations of current interest in mechanisms, the contributions
of Americans to international conferences on mechanisms reflects the growing
recognition of the value of scholarly investigation of the kind that can
scarcely hope to yield immediately tangible results.</p>

<p>While we look to the future, one may ask how a lengthy view of the past can
be justified. It seems to me that there is inherent in the almost feverish
activity of the present the danger of becoming so preoccupied with operational
theory that the goals may become clouded and the synthesis (let us put it less
elegantly: the design) of mechanisms may never quite come into focus. If one
knows nothing of the past, I wonder how he can with any confidence decide in
what direction he must turn in order to face the future.</p>

1909, vol. 2.</p>

<p>This subject index was started in 1908, and by 1914 three volumes (the third
in two parts) had been published; however, this subject index was never
completed. Volume 2, titled <em>Mechanics</em>, has some 200 entries under &quot;Linkages.&quot;
It is interesting to note that both of the Royal Society's monumental catalogs
grew out of a suggestion made by Joseph Henry at a British Association meeting
in Glasgow in 1855.</p>

<h4>CONFERENCE ON MECHANISMS.</h4>

<p>This conference was sponsored by Purdue University and <em>Machine Design</em>.
Transactions of the first two conferences appeared as special sections in
<em>Machine Design</em>, December 1953, vol. 25, pp. 173-220, December 1954, vol. 26,
pp. 187-236, and in collected reprints. Papers of the third and fourth
conferences (May 1956 and October 1957) appeared in <em>Machine Design</em> over
several months following each conference and in collected reprints. Papers of
the fifth conference (October 1958) were collected and preprinted for conference
participants; subsequently, all papers appeared in <em>Machine Design</em>. Collected
reprints and preprints are available (May 1960) from Penton Publishing Company,
Cleveland, Ohio.</p>

<p>This article evoked interesting discussion. It is unfortunate that
Grodzinski's periodical, <em>Mechanism, An International Bibliography</em>, which was
published in London in 1956-1957 and which terminated shortly after his death,
has not been revived. Grodzinski's incisive views and informative essays are
valuable and interesting.</p>
